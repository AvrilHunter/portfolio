      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Transitioning from a career in procurement to Software Development
        exciting and fulfilling. The technical knowledge gained from completion
        of the 13 week industry leading Northcoders bootcamp alongside my
        communication, project management and problem solving skills developed
        in procurement allow me to bring an analytical and diverse skill set to
        my next role.
      </p>

        Championships. The highlight of my playing career was winning Silver at
        the Ultimate Frisbee European Championships 2023 competing with Great
        Britain Women.
